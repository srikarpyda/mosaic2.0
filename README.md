# mosaic2.0

This code features 2 different implementations of image mosaic creation. 

* One is a sequential implementation in MATLAB 
* The other is a parallelized version that invokes a CUDA kernel from within MATLAB, running the most computationally intensive parts of the program in parallel on a GPU

This project was submitted as the final project for a graduate Parallel Programming seminar at Duke University.
